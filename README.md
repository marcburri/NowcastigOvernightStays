# Nowcasting the number of overnight stays using STLM

This repository contains the replication code and the reproducibility description for the approach who won the second price in the European Tourism Nowcasting Accuracy Challenge, as well as the first price in the European Tourism Nowcasting Reproducibility Challenge. For more information, see [https://statistics-awards.eu/competitions/3](https://statistics-awards.eu/competitions/3).

The approach is based on the seasonal and trend decomposition using Loess (STL) method, which is a robust and flexible method for decomposing time series data. The method is implemented in the R package `stlm` from the `forecast` package.
